GroupAccess is a comprehensive web-based portal that enables Alabama employers to manage health, dental, and vision insurance plans through Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama. I served as a core developer on this project for over 4 years.

## My Role

As a core developer on the GroupAccess team from 2017 to 2022, I was responsible for:

- Developing and maintaining member portal features
- Building employer-facing tools for plan management
- Implementing premium estimation and rate quote calculators
- Creating user registration and authentication workflows
- Working in an agile development environment with a small, focused team

## Key Features

- **Plan Selection & Comparison** - Enables employers to shop and compare business and employer plans across different company sizes

- **Premium Estimation Tools** - Rate quote calculator generating estimated monthly premiums based on employee census data and residential zip codes

- **Additional Coverage Options** - Integration with DentalBlue and VisionBlue supplemental plans

- **Educational Resources** - GroupAccess Overview Booklet, instructional videos, and registration tutorials

- **User Management** - Account registration, login, and password recovery systems

## Technical Stack

The project was built using enterprise Java technologies with Liferay Portal for content management. We used Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, following enterprise software development best practices for a healthcare industry application.

## Impact

GroupAccess serves thousands of Alabama employers, providing them with the tools to manage employee health benefits efficiently. The portal handles sensitive healthcare data and requires strict security and compliance standards.
