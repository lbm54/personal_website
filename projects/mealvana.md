Mealvana is an automated meal planning application designed to solve the common problem of deciding "what's for dinner?" The service aims to make dinner planning easier, healthier, and more enjoyable.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Menu Generation** - The app learns your individual food preferences and creates customized meal plans that align with your dietary needs, daily routines, and eating habits.

- **Curated Recipe Library** - Mealvana provides carefully selected recipes designed to be both delicious and practical for everyday cooking.

- **Automated Shopping Lists** - The platform generates streamlined shopping lists that help you zoom through the store efficiently, simplifying the grocery shopping process.

- **Nutrition Tracking** - Built-in nutrition measurement and optimization features allow you to easily monitor dietary intake.

## The Problem We Solve

Mealvana addresses the decision fatigue many households experience around meal planning. By providing an "autopilot" solution, we remove the guesswork and debate from dinner planning while promoting healthier eating habits.

## Technical Implementation

Built with Flutter for a native mobile experience, Mealvana uses Firebase for real-time data synchronization and AI-powered recommendation algorithms to continuously improve meal suggestions based on user feedback and preferences.
